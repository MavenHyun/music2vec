Daft Punk	Face To Face	What's going on? Could this be my understanding It's not your fault I was being too demanding I must admit it's my pride that made me distant All because I hoped that you'd be someone different There's not much I know about you Fear will always make you blind But the answer is in clear view It's amazing what you'll find face to face I turned away because I thought you were the problem Tried to forget until I hit the bottom But when I faced you in my blank confusion I realized you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion It really didn't make sense Just to leave this unresolved It's not hard to go the distance when you finally get involved face to face

Daft Punk	Instant Crush	[Verse 1] I didn't want to be the one to forget I thought of everything I'd never regret A little time with you is all that I get That's all we need because it's all we can take One thing I never see the same when you're 'round I don't believe in him—his lips on the ground I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche" But no one gives us any time anymore He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog You made an offer for it, then you ran off I got this picture of us kids in my head And all I hear is the last thing that you said [Pre-chorus] "I listened to your problems Now listen to mine." I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh [Chorus] And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend Some more again [Verse 2] It didn't matter what they wanted to see He thought he saw someone that looked just like me The summer memory that just never dies We worked too long and hard to give it no time He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall He cannot break it down or else he would fall One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore [Pre-chorus] "I listened to your problems Now listen to mine." I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh [Chorus] And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door... I don't understand, don't get upset I'm not with you We're swimming around, It's all I do, when I'm with you [Chorus] And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
